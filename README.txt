I chose to design a website targeted at the active over-75's. 
I made a website for 'Royal Ballroom', a ballroom dancing
school for people over 75 that takes into account the specific
needs of each student.

What is found on the website:
The website contains information about Royal Ballroom, such as a 
description, the team members, and a bit of history. It also contains
informatin about the different classes provided, pricing, and schedules.
A user can register for classes on the website. Finally, contact 
information is provided.

Design decisions:
Since the website is for people over 75, I made sure the font 
and input elements were big, that there was enough space between
elements, and that the website was as simple as possible.
I chose colors that were bright and warm, to provide a feeling
of a fun, sociable, and happy place. I avoided dropdown menus
since they are more difficult to use with shaky hands that may 
not be used to using a mouse.
I chose to use a fluid layout because horizontal scrolling really
annoys me. I also made this decision because having to horizontally
scroll would be especially hard for elderly people who are not
used to using a mouse. All elements are big enough that the screen 
would have to be very small for anything to overlap because of the 
fluid layout.
I also included the option of changing the font size in the header
in case the user would be more comfortable with a different sized font.
On the pages under 'About Us' and 'Classes', a navigation bar is
provided on the left, in addition to the navigation bar at the top, to
make the dropdown menu options more accessible. The navigation bar
on the left and the content on the right are sized according to the 
divine proportion.
I used images only where they would really add something to the content
so as to keep the site simple. While I would have liked to include
a video on the homepage, I did not find one that would be appropriate
for the site.
When registering, if the user chooses to pay in person rather than online,
the card information options will be hidden so as to not confuse the user.
